# `Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)`

## Definition:
AI enables computers, robots, or software to mimic human intelligence by learning, deciding, and solving problems. 

## Origin: 

- Coined by John McCarthy in 1956.
- Scientists explored independent problem-solving using computers. 

## Human vs. Machine Intelligence: 

- Humans use patterns for memory; machines rely on search algorithms.
- Humans recognize incomplete data, while machines struggle with it. 

## Can Machines Think? 

- The Turing Test determines if a machine's responses are indistinguishable from a humanâ€™s. 

## Goals of AI: 

- `Expert Systems:` Intelligent systems that provide advice.
- `Human-Like Intelligence:` Machines that think and learn like humans. 

## Contributors to AI: 

- `Mathematics:` Algorithms, logic.
- `Computer Science:` Programming, databases.
- `Neuroscience:` Brain-inspired computing.
- `Linguistics:` Natural Language Processing.
- `Cognitive Science:` Learning and decision-making. 

## Why Study AI?
