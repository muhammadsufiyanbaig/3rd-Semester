# AI Lecture 2-3: Fundamentals and Systems

## Goals of AI

- **Create Expert Systems**: AI that learns, explains, and advises users
- **Mimic Human Intelligence**: Machines that think and behave like humans

## Types of AI

- **Weak AI** (Narrow AI)
  - Task-specific, pre-programmed intelligence
  - Examples: Siri, Chess AI, recommendation systems
  
- **Strong AI** (General AI)
  - Independent thinking and reasoning capabilities
  - Examples: Self-driving cars, advanced autonomous systems

## AI Capabilities & Key Questions

- Can AI match human intelligence?
- Can AI self-improve and be autonomous?
- Can AI revolutionize industries through:
  - Fraud detection
  - Handwriting recognition
  - Other complex tasks

## Current State of AI

### What AI Can Do ✅
- Master chess and complex games
- Plan space missions
- Perform real-time translation

### What AI Struggles With ❌
- Writing genuinely funny jokes
- Fully autonomous urban driving
- Advanced reasoning and common sense

## Comparing Intelligence Types

| Human Intelligence | Artificial Intelligence |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Common sense, creativity, reasoning | Mimics human cognition |
| Slow processing, memory limitations | Fast, data-heavy processing |
| Intuition-based decision making | Lacks adaptability and common sense |

## Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)

Knowledge-Based Systems are AI applications that use stored knowledge for problem-solving:

- **Expert Systems**: Specialized AI designed to replace human experts in specific domains
- Uses structured knowledge representation to make decisions

## Key Takeaways

1. AI is evolving rapidly but still lacks human-like common sense
2. Weak AI handles specific tasks while Strong AI aims for independent reasoning
3. Knowledge-Based Systems provide valuable decision support in expert fields
