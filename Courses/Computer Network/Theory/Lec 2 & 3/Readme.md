# **What is a Computer Network?**
- A group of interconnected computers.
- Can be wired or wireless.

## **Types of Networks**
1. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**
   - Limited to personal devices.
   - Wireless PAN (WPAN) connects to the internet.

2. **LAN (Local Area Network)**
   - Limited to a building or small area.
   - Used in schools, labs, offices.

3. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
   - Connects LANs across large geographical areas.
   - Uses telephone lines & radio waves.

4. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
   - Covers a city or university campus.
   - Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN.

5. **Other Networks**
   - WLAN (Wireless LAN)
   - SAN (Storage Area Network)
   - System-Area Network (Server-to-server applications)
   - EPN (Enterprise Private Network)
   - CAN (Campus Area Network)
   - VPN (Virtual Private Network)

# **Computer Network Components**
- **Essential Components**: Devices, cables, routers, switches, network interfaces.
- **Unique Network Identifiers**: IP addresses, MAC addresses.

## **Uses of Computer Networks**
- Resource sharing (printers, databases)
- Fast and effective communication
- Data exchange between users

## **Advantages of Networking**
- Multiple computer connections
- Shared printers and scanners
- Fast data transfer
- Cost-effective electronic communication

## **Disadvantages of Networking**
- High initial cost (hardware/software)
- Security vulnerabilities (hacking, data loss)
- Requires maintenance & administration
- Risk of server failure and cable faults

# **Network Topologies**
## **Logical vs. Physical Topologies**
- **Logical Topology**: Conceptual design of the network.
  - Examples: Peer-to-Peer, Client-Server.
- **Physical Topology**: Actual physical layout of devices.

## **Types of Physical Topologies**
1. **Point-to-Point (P2P)**
   - Direct connection between two computers.
   - Used for close-proximity communication.

2. **Bus Topology**
   - Single backbone cable connects all devices.
   - If backbone fails, entire network collapses.
   - Used in small LANs.

3. **Ring Topology**
   - Computers connected in a closed loop.
   - Alternative paths exist for data in case of failure.

4. **Star Topology**
   - Devices connected to a central hub.
   - Popular in LANs.

5. **Mesh Topology**
   - Every device connected to every other device.
   - Ensures redundancy but is costly.

6. **Tree Topology**
   - Hierarchical structure with a root node.
   - Combines multiple star networks.
