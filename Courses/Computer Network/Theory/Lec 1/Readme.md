Here are summarized notes based on the PowerPoint presentation:  
# **Chapter 1: Data Communications and Networking**

## **1.1 Data Communications**
- **Definition:** Exchange of data between two devices via a transmission medium (e.g., wire cable).
- **Components of a Data Communication System:** Sender, receiver, transmission medium, protocol.
- **Data Flow Types:**  
  - **Simplex:** One-way communication.  
  - **Half-Duplex:** Two-way communication but only one direction at a time.  
  - **Full-Duplex:** Two-way communication simultaneously.  

## **1.2 Networks**
- **Definition:** A set of devices (nodes) connected via communication links.
- **Network Criteria:**  
  - **Performance:** Measured in delay and throughput.  
  - **Reliability:** Based on availability and failure rates.  
  - **Security:** Protection from data loss/errors/malicious activities.  
- **Physical Structures:**  
  - **Point-to-Point:** Direct connection between two nodes.  
  - **Multipoint:** Multiple devices share a single communication medium.  
- **Network Topologies:**  
  - **Mesh:** Reliable but requires many connections.  
  - **Star:** Scalable but dependent on a central hub.  
  - **Bus:** Easy installation but has collision risks.  
  - **Ring:** Sequential data flow but failure in one device affects the network.  
  - **Hybrid:** Combination of topologies, e.g., star-bus hybrid.  
- **Categories of Networks:**  
  - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small geographical area (e.g., office).  
  - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city or campus.  
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers a large geographical area (e.g., the Internet).  

## **1.3 The Internet**
- **Impact:** Revolutionized business, communication, and leisure.  
- **Organization of the Internet:**  
  - **ISPs (Internet Service Providers):** Hierarchical structure providing access to the Internet.  

## **1.4 Protocols**
- **Definition:** A set of rules governing data communications.  
- **Key Elements:**  
  - **Syntax:** Structure/format of data.  
  - **Semantics:** Meaning of each data bit.  
  - **Timing:** When and at what speed data should be transmitted.
