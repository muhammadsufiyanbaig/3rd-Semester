# `Principles that Guide Practice`

### **1. Core Principles of Software Engineering**  
- **Software knowledge evolves**, but core principles remain timeless.  

### **2. Principles that Guide Process**  
1. **Be Agile** – Adapt to change effectively.  
2. **Focus on Quality** – Ensure high-quality deliverables.  
3. **Be Adaptable** – Adjust to project needs.  
4. **Build Effective Teams** – Foster mutual trust.  
5. **Establish Communication** – Avoid miscommunication failures.  
6. **Manage Change** – Handle requests and modifications effectively.  
7. **Assess Risks** – Plan for uncertainties.  
8. **Create Valuable Work Products** – Focus on deliverables that add value.  

### **3. Principles that Guide Practice**  
1. **Divide & Conquer** – Use modularization and separation of concerns.  
2. **Use Abstraction** – Simplify complexity.  
3. **Ensure Consistency** – Familiarity improves usability.  
4. **Focus on Information Flow** – Interfaces should be well-structured.  
5. **Build Modular Software** – Maintain clean architecture.  
6. **Look for Patterns** – Solve recurring problems efficiently.  
7. **Use Multiple Perspectives** – View problems from different angles.  
8. **Plan for Maintainability** – Future-proof your code.  

### **4. Communication Principles**  
- **Active listening**, clear documentation, and effective collaboration.  
- **Use face-to-face communication** when possible.  
- **Stay focused** and modularize discussions.  
- **Negotiate effectively**—it's not a competition.  

### **5. Planning Principles**  
- **Understand project scope** and involve customers.  
- **Iterative planning** is necessary.  
- **Consider risks and remain realistic**.  
- **Plan for quality assurance and changes**.  

### **6. Modeling Principles**  
- **Requirements models** define information, function, and behavior.  
- **Design models** ensure system architecture, UI, and component structure.  

### **7. Agile Modeling Principles**  
- **Prioritize software over excessive modeling**.  
- **Keep models simple and adaptable**.  
- **Seek feedback early and often**.  

### **8. Construction Principles**  
- **Understand the problem before coding**.  
- **Follow structured programming** and use meaningful variable names.  
- **Write self-documenting code**.  

### **9. Testing & Validation**  
- **Tests must trace back to requirements**.  
- **Plan tests early** and start with small components.  
- **Refactor code based on test results**.  

### **10. Deployment Principles**  
- **Manage customer expectations**.  
- **Ensure complete & tested software delivery**.  
- **Provide support and instructional materials**.  
- **Fix critical bugs before release**.
