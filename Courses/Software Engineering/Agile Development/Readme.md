### **1. Agile Manifesto**
- **Prioritizes**: Individuals & interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and adaptability over rigid processes.

### **2. Agility in Software Development**
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Rapid response to change.
  - Effective team communication.
  - Continuous customer involvement.
  - Incremental software delivery.

### **3. Agile Process**
- **Customer-driven development** with iterative software releases.
- **Recognizes short-lived plans** & changing priorities.
- **Delivers working software increments** for feedback & adaptation.

### **4. Agile Principles**
1. Early & continuous software delivery.
2. Welcome changing requirements.
3. Frequent releases (weeks/months).
4. Close collaboration between business & developers.
5. Build around motivated individuals.
6. Face-to-face communication is key.
7. Working software = progress.
8. Sustainable pace for development.
9. Emphasize technical excellence & simplicity.
10. Self-organizing teams create the best solutions.
11. Regular reflection & adaptation.

### **5. Pros & Cons of Agile**
**Pros**: Fast, flexible, promotes teamwork, minimal documentation, quick delivery.  
**Cons**: Not suited for complex dependencies, requires high customer involvement, minimal documentation can hinder new team members.

## **Extreme Programming (XP)**
- **Core Practices**:
  - **Pair Programming** & **Code Reviews**.
  - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
  - **Frequent small releases**.
  - **Continuous integration**.
  - **User stories** for requirement gathering.

### **XP Best For**:
- Small teams, fast-changing projects, research-based development.

## **Scrum Methodology**
- **Three Phases**:
  1. **Planning**: Define goals.
  2. **Sprints (2-4 weeks)**: Incremental development.
  3. **Closure**: Final review & documentation.

### **Key Features**:
- **Daily Standups** (short progress meetings).
- **Backlog Management** (work prioritization).
- **Scrum Master** (facilitator, removes roadblocks).
- **Sprint Demos** (frequent feedback from customers).

### **Scrum Benefits**:
- Manages unstable requirements.
- Improves team communication.
- Ensures frequent customer feedback.

## **Other Agile Models**
- **Adaptive Software Development (ASD)**
- **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**
- **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**
- **Lean Software Development (LSD)**

---

### **Conclusion**
- Agile ensures **flexibility, adaptability, and rapid delivery**.
- XP & Scrum are widely used frameworks.
- **Not suitable** for projects with **high complexity & dependencies**.
