# `Process Models`

A _software process model_ provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring stability, control, and organization.

---

## Generic Process Model

Consists of five key activities:

1. _Communication_ – Requirement gathering.
2. _Planning_ – Scheduling, resource allocation.
3. _Modeling_ – System design.
4. _Construction_ – Coding and testing.
5. _Deployment_ – Delivery and maintenance.

Additional _umbrella activities_ include project tracking, risk management, and quality assurance.

## Types of Process Flows

1. _Linear Flow_ – Sequential execution (e.g., Waterfall).
2. _Iterative Flow_ – Repeats phases before proceeding.
3. _Evolutionary Flow_ – Continuous improvement (e.g., Prototyping).
4. _Parallel Flow_ – Activities run simultaneously.

## Major Software Development Models

### 1. Waterfall Model (Linear Sequential)

- _Phases:_ Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
- ✅ Simple, structured, well-documented.
- ❌ No early working product, not flexible for changing requirements.

### 2. V-Model (Verification & Validation)

- _Enhancement of Waterfall_, with testing at each phase.
- ✅ Ensures early defect detection.
- ❌ Rigid, unsuitable for evolving projects.

### 3. Incremental Model

- _Delivers software in multiple increments._
- ✅ Faster product delivery, flexible to changes.
- ❌ Requires careful planning for iterations.

### 4. Evolutionary Models

- _Prototyping Model_ – Rapid development of a working prototype for feedback.
  - ✅ User-friendly, early issue detection.
  - ❌ Risk of unrealistic expectations.
- _Spiral Model_ – Combines iterative development with risk management.
  - ✅ Best for large, high-risk projects.
  - ❌ Complex and costly.

## Comparison of Models

| Model         | Best For                     | Pros                | Cons                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| _Waterfall_   | Small, well-defined projects | Simple, structured  | No early working product |
| _V-Model_     | Critical systems             | Strong validation   | Not flexible             |
| _Incremental_ | Evolving requirements        | Faster delivery     | Needs iteration planning |
| _Prototyping_ | Unclear requirements         | Early user feedback | Unrealistic expectations |
| _Spiral_      | Large, high-risk projects    | Risk management     | Expensive                |

## Key Takeaways

- Choose the _right model_ based on project needs.
- _Waterfall_ is rigid but structured.
- _Incremental & Prototyping_ allow flexibility.
- _Spiral_ is best for _complex projects with high risks_.
