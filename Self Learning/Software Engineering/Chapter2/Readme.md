# CHAPTER #01: SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT & SPECIFICATIONS

---

## Requirement Engineering Process
The hardest part of building a software is deciding precisely what is to be built. Requirement engineering is the disciplined application of proven principle, methods, tools and notations to describe a proposed system's intended behaviour and its associated constraints.

**Difficulties of Requirement Engineering**
- `Requirement are difficult to uncover`: no one give the complete requirement in the first time, if someone does then also requirement are incomplete.
- `Requirement Changes`: with the development process requirements get added and changed as the user begins to understand the system and his or her real need.
- `Tight Project Schedule`: have insufficient time to do a decent job.
- `Communication Barrier`: user and developer have different technical background and tastes.
- `Lack of resources`: there may not be enough resources to build software that can do everything the customer wants.

**Type of Requirement**
- `Known requirement`: Which is already known to stake holder
- `Unknown requirement`: Forgotten by stake holder because that are not needed right now.
- `Undreament requirement`: StakeHolder is unable to think of new requirement due to limited domain knowledge.

*There are majorly four steps in requirement analysisÂ·*
- `Requirement Elicitation`: Gathering of Requirement.
- `Requirement Analysis`: Requirements are analysed to identify inconsistences, defects etc and to resolve conflicts.
- `Requirement documentation`: Here we document all the refined requirement properly.
- `Requirement Review`: Review is carried out to improve the quality of the SRS.

### Elicitation

**Methods of requirement elicitation**
Is the most difficult, most critical, most error-prone and communication intensive aspect of the s/w development. It can only succeed only through an effective customer developer partnership.

 **Interview**
- Both parties would like to understand each other
Interview can be of two types open-ended or structured
- In open ended, there is no present agenda, context free questions can be asked to understand the problem, to have an over view over the situation 
- In structured interview, agenda is pre-set.

**Brain Storming**
-  A kind of group discussion, which lead to ideas very quickly and help to promote creative thinking.
- Very popular now a days and is being used in most of the organizations.
- All participants are encouraged to say whatever idea come to their mind and no one will be criticized for any idea no matter how goofy it seems.

**Delphi technique**
Here participants are made to write the requirement on a piece of paper, then these requirements are exchanged among participants who gave their comments to get a revised set of requirements. This process is repeated till the final consensus is reached

**FAST (facilitated application specification technique)**
- This approach encourages the creation of joint team of customer and developer who works together to understand correct set of requirements
-  Everyone is asked to prepare a list of 
    - What surrounds the system.
    - Produced by the system.
    - Used by the system.
    - List of service, constraints, and performance criterion.
    - Then we divide these lists into smaller list to work in smaller teams.

**QFD (quality functional deployment):**
-  Its emphases to incorporate the voice of the customer with importance
-  Then according to customer, a value indicating a degree of importance, is assigned to each requirement. Thus, the customer, determine the importance of each requirement on a scale of 1 to 5 as:
    - `5 points`: very important 4 points: important
    - `3 points`: not important but nice to have
    - `2 point`: not important 1 point: unrealistic, requires

**Use case approach**
- These are structured description of the user requirement. It is a narrative which describe the sequence of events from user's perspective.
- Use case diagrams are graphical representation to show the system at different levels.
- They are some times supportive my the activity diagrams, to understand the work flow.
