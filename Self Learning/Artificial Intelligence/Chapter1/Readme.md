# CHAPTER #01: INTRODUCTION

## History of Al
- During the Second World War, British computer scientist Alan Turing worked to crack the 'Enigma' code which was used by German forces to send messages securely. Alan Turing and his team created the Bombe machine that was used to decipher Enigma's messages.
- The Enigma and Bombe Machines laid the foundations for Machine Learning.

## First work in Al
- The first work that is now generally recognized as Al was done by Warren McCulloh and Walter Pits in 1943. They drew on three sources:
    - Knowledge of basic Physiology and Functions of Neurons in brain.
    - A formal analysis of propositional logic
    - Turing's Theory of Computation

## Key Findings
- They proposed a model of artificial neurons in which each neuron can be characterized as being on and off.
- They showed that any computable function could be computed by some network of connected neurons.
- They also suggested that suitably defined networks can also learn.

## Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach
- The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence.
- A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
